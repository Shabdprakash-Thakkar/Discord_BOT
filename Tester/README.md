# Supporter BOT

A multi-functional Discord bot designed to automate server management and enhance user engagement. This bot features a comprehensive leveling system, YouTube notifications, automated time-channel updates, and media-only channel enforcement, all managed through intuitive slash commands. It is built to be robust, scalable, and easy for server administrators to configure.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **üèÜ Advanced Leveling System:** Engage your community by rewarding users with XP for their activity. The system includes automatic role rewards for reaching new levels, a server-wide leaderboard to foster competition, and a dedicated channel for level-up announcements. For seasonal events, administrators can perform a manual or scheduled automatic reset of all user XP and roles.

* **üì¢ YouTube Notifications:** Automatically announce new video uploads, livestreams, and premieres from your favorite YouTube channels. Features a customizable message with role mentions and a helper command to easily find any channel's ID.

* **üö´ No-Text Channel Enforcement:** Create dedicated media-only channels where plain text is not allowed. The bot will automatically remove text-only messages and send a temporary notification, guiding users to the correct channel for conversations. A role-based bypass system allows designated members to override this restriction.

* **‚è∞ Live Time Channels:** Keep your server's international community synchronized with voice channels that automatically update their names to display the current date, India Standard Time (IST), and Japan Standard Time (JST).

* **‚öôÔ∏è Easy Configuration & Control:** All features are managed through simple slash commands. A dedicated `/show-config` command allows administrators to get a quick overview of all bot settings, while owner-only commands provide full control over the bot's presence in different servers.

## üöÄ Setup and Installation Guide

### Step 1: Prerequisites

Before you begin, you will need:

* Python 3.8 or a newer version installed.
* A Discord Bot application created on the Discord Developer Portal.
* A free project set up on a PostgreSQL database.
* A Google Cloud Project with the **YouTube Data API v3** enabled to get an API key.

### Step 2: Bot Installation

Download the project files to your computer. It is highly recommended to create and activate a Python virtual environment inside the project folder. Once your environment is active, install all the necessary Python libraries by running the command to install from the `requirements.txt` file.

### Step 3: Database Configuration

The bot uses a database to store all persistent data. In your Database project's SQL Editor, you will need to create the required tables for the bot to function, including tables for `users`, `level_roles`, `level_notify_channel`, `last_notified_level`, `bypass_roles`, `auto_reset`, `youtube_notifications`, and `banned_guilds`.

### Step 4: Environment Variables

Create a new file named `.env` inside the `Data_Files` folder. In this file, you must provide your bot's private token from the Discord Developer Portal, the URL and public key from your Database project's API settings, and your **YouTube Data API v3 key** from the Google Cloud Console.

### Step 5: Running the Bot

Once all the previous steps are completed and your credentials are in place, you can run the main startup script to bring the bot online in your server.
