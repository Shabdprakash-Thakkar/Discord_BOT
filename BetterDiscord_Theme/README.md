## ‚ú® Features

*   **Live Video Background:** A subtle, looping video plays behind the Discord client.
*   **Frosted Glass UI:** Key interface elements (server list, channels, chat, user panel) have a modern blur effect, making them look like panes of glass.
*   **High Readability:** Unlike many transparent themes, the background panes are dark enough to ensure all text is easy to read, with no distracting text-shadows.
*   **Custom Accent Color:** Easily customizable accent color (`--main-theme-color`) to make it your own.
*   **Clean & Modern Font:** Uses the "Inter" font for a clean, professional look.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

This theme and plugin require a modded Discord client. The installation guide below uses **BetterDiscord**.

## üöÄ Installation Guide

You need **both files** for the theme to work correctly. The `.css` file styles the UI, and the `.js` file adds the video background.

### Step 1: Download the Theme Files

2.  `MrStrangerVideo.plugin.js` (The video background loader)

### Step 2: Locate Your BetterDiscord Folders

1.  Open Discord.
2.  Go to **User Settings** (the cog icon ‚öôÔ∏è in the bottom-left).
3.  Scroll down to the **BetterDiscord** section in the settings menu.
4.  Click on **Themes**.
5.  Click the **"Open Themes Folder"** button. A folder will pop up on your computer.
6.  Go back to Discord settings and click on **Plugins**.
7.  Click the **"Open Plugins Folder"** button. A second folder will pop up.

### Step 3: Place the Files

Now you will move the downloaded files into the folders you just opened.
