## üöÄ Setup and Installation Guide

### Step 1: Prerequisites

Before you begin, you will need:

* Python 3.8 or a newer version installed on your system.
* A Discord Bot application with a Token, created on the Discord Developer Portal.
* A free account and a new project set up on Supabase for the database.

### Step 2: Bot Installation

First, download the project files to your computer. It is highly recommended to create and activate a Python virtual environment inside the `Supporter_BOT` folder to manage dependencies. Then, install all the necessary Python libraries by running the `requirements.txt` file located in the `Data_Files` directory.

### Step 3: Database Configuration

The bot uses a Supabase database to store all user data. In your Supabase project's SQL Editor, you must create six tables with the following structure:

* **`users` Table:** Stores the XP and level for each user. It needs columns for `guild_id`, `user_id`, `xp`, and `level`.
* **`level_roles` Table:** Stores the roles to be awarded at certain levels. It needs columns for `guild_id`, `level`, and `role_id`.
* **`level_notify_channel` Table:** Stores the channel ID for level-up notifications. It needs columns for `guild_id` and `channel_id`.
* **`last_notified_level` Table:** Tracks the last level a user was notified for to prevent spam. It needs columns for `guild_id`, `user_id`, and `level`.
* **`bypass_roles` Table:** Stores roles that can bypass the no-text channel rules. It needs columns for `guild_id` and `role_id`.
* **`auto_reset` Table:** Stores the automatic XP reset schedule. It needs columns for `guild_id`, `days`, and `last_reset`.

### Step 4: Environment Variables

Create a file named `.env` inside the `Data_Files` folder. This file will securely store your bot's secret credentials. You need to add three variables to this file:

1. `DISCORD_TOKEN`: Your bot's token from the Discord Developer Portal.
2. `SUPABASE_URL`: The project URL from your Supabase API settings.
3. `SUPABASE_KEY`: The `anon` `public` key from your Supabase API settings.

### Step 5: Running the Bot

Once everything is configured, run the `run_supporter.py` script to start the bot.

## üìÇ Project Structure

The project is organized into several key files and directories:

* **`run_supporter.py`**: The main script used to start the bot.
* **`Python_Files/`**: This directory contains the core logic for each feature.
  * `supporter.py`: The main bot file where all modules are initialized and commands are registered.
  * `level.py`: Manages the entire leveling system.
  * `no_text.py`: Manages the media-only channel feature.
  * `date_and_time.py`: Manages the automatic time channel updates.
  * `help.py`: Manages the `/help` command.
* **`Data_Files/`**: This directory stores configuration and data.
  * `.env`: Your private credentials.
  * `requirements.txt`: A list of all Python libraries the bot needs.
  * `no_text.json` & `date_and_time.json`: Local storage for channel configurations.
